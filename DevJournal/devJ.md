# Collobaration Project 

## Game Artificial Intelligence

FGCT7011
## Overview
This is a collaborative team project for the FGCT7011 Game Artificial Intelligence module. Our game is called “Project Ebonkeep”. This game is a boss fight 3D game with a medieval theme powered by game AI and was created using Unreal Engine 5.
The main objective of the game is for the player to go to a castle and defeat the AI-controlled guards, sword and bow guards there. After defeating them, the player has to search a special potion and increases his health, unlocks the fire arrow power, and faces the final large golem boss enemy.
The golem boss, sword guards and bow guards all of these are created using behavior trees and blueprints. Additionally, the game also has NPC characters called villagers. We do not use behavior trees for them, but only regular blueprints.
Our team consists of six people: three artists, two programmers and a designer. Everyone was new to Unreal Engine. So it was important to learn from each other on the project. When one didn’t know, the other helped. By being able to work well in a team environment.
My contribution to this project was to create smart AI Guards using behaviour trees. This included both sword guards and bow guards. Another contribution was to create the villagers NPC characters. Although the villager AI didn’t use behavior trees and i used blueprint and AI perception for them.
The behavior tree for the boss enemy was created by another programmer. However, I closely studied his work and helped him debug bugs when needed.
I became interested in behavior trees, AI perception systems (how the AI ​​reacts to its environment), and AI decision-making in Unreal Engine 5 through research based on YouTube tutorials, Unreal Engine documentation, and indie game developers.

## Research 
### Methodology  
 For this project, I researched several sources related to game AI. Through these researches, I learnt important principles, techniques, and practical examples of applications. I created the AI ​​system of "Project Ebonkeep" using YouTube tutorials from great game developers such as Gorka Games, Ali Elzoheiry, and Ryan Laley. And also i reearched official Unreal Engine documentation, and information available on Unreal Engine Dev community page.

Through this research, I was able to:
- Get a deep understanding of Behavior Trees
- Develop AI Perception Systems
- Understand the decision-making mechanisms in the game
- Create different types of AI agents (soldiers, archers, villagers)

My research methodology includes the following steps:
Collect and study free online resources
Obtain technical information from the Unreal Engine wiki and official documentation
After studying the resources, conduct experiments on various AI concepts
Improvement of AI systems based on the experiments

### Game Sources  
1. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
The mechanism used for the AI ​​minor enemies (Guards, Bandits) in The Witcher 3 was used as a guide for the swordsmen and archers in our "Project Ebonkeep". In particular, the way enemies explore, detect suspicious activity, and provide early warning of attacks were used. What makes The Witcher 3's AI system unique is its ability to respond to natural routines and the environment.

I used the following concepts when developing the Guards AI:
- Patrol Routes
- Suspicious Activity Detection
- Switching of instruments (Normal, Investigation, Attack)

2. Assassin's Creed Series
The NPC interaction system in the Assassin's Creed series was a very special source for the development of the AI ​​in my game. The way the NPC characters in this game communicate with each other and how they interact with the player was a big inspiration for me. For example, the way the guards converse with each other, exchange information with each other, and converse with the player is a feature I would like to include in the AI ​​system of my game. I am currently working on adding this feature to the game "Project Ebonkeep".

The features that I am implementing from the Assassin's Creed series are:

- Dialogue and interaction system between NPC characters
- Interaction system between NPC characters and the player
- Social behavior patterns and response system
- Exchange of information between NPCs about suspicious activity
